# PHP-MySQL-Fall-2022
This repository hosts my PHP code for my class so I can showcase the various applications I have made using PHP. All of the SQL data within this repository is not connected to any important databases and is used only for educational purposes. None of the usernames and hashed passwords are related to actual accounts on official websites.
